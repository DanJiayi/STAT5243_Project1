When encountering an OOM issue, you may need to restart the session and rerun specific parts. It occasionally occurs during the denoising and marker identification steps, but the process can be completed successfully after restarting.
 (*If you have run scVI, I strongly recommend restarting the session and rerun the code without performing scVI before executing the following steps to avoid potential OOM issue.*)
